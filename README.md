Mugraph (pronounced *"mew-graph"*) is a Layer 2 Network for the Cardano blochchain for anonymous payments with instant finality.

It is not a blockchain but a payment network, where **Delegators** hold and transact funds (inside a smart contract vault) on behalf of users. Delegators can connect between each other as **Galaxies** and route payments directly between them, akin to the [Lightning Network](https://lightning.network).
