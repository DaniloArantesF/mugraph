> Why are people not using cryptocurrencies for payments?

This is the question I wanted to address when Mugraph started. Bitcoin was created to address this specific problem, yet [The Lightning Network](https://lightning.network) is not widely supported even in countries that adopted Bitcoin as legal tender.

Even if Cardano has much more advanced technology than Bitcoin does (like eUTXO or Smart Contracts), buying groceries with [USDM](https://mehen.io) remains nighly impossible.

ZeroHedge explains this phenomenon in their article ["What Happened to Bitcoin?"](https://www.zerohedge.com/crypto/what-happened-bitcoin):

> At the same time, new technologies were becoming available that vastly improved the efficiency and availability of exchange in fiat dollars. They included Venmo, Zelle, CashApp, FB payments, and many others besides, in addition to smartphone attachments and iPads that enabled any merchant of any size to process credit cards. These technologies were completely different from Bitcoin because they were permission-based and mediated by financial companies. But to users, they seemed great and their presence in the marketplace crowded out the use case of Bitcoin at the very time that my beloved technology had become an unrecognizable version of itself.

Excluding volatility (already being taken seriously by Stablecoins), we identified three main problems that prevent the average person from considering cryptocurrencies as a payment option:

1. **Scalability**: Cryptocurrency transactions are slow compared to centralized solutions. For example, credit cards have a practical confirmation limit of 2 seconds.

1. **Privacy**: Users do not want to reveal their identity for every purchase. Financial privacy is a human right, and in the age of big data analysis and AI, pseudonymity does not provide sufficient privacy.

1. **Ease of Use**: Users prefer not to deal with complex protocols, multiple wallets, or extensive security considerations.

Solving those problems is why we created Mugraph.
