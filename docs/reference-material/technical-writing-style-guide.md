# Technical Writing Style Guide

## General Guidelines:

1. Write for a global audience, avoiding slang and culture-specific terminology.
1. Aim for a readability score of 60-70 on the Flesch-Kincaid reading ease scale.
1. Target a Gunning Fog index of 9-12 for comprehension level.
1. Write for an audience with a minimum reading level of an eighth-grade student (14-15 years old).
1. Be accurate, consistent, and user-focused without patronizing or making assumptions about skills.

### Grammar and Style:

1. Use active voice whenever possible.
1. Ensure proper agreement between subjects and verbs, and between pronouns and their antecedents.
1. Use the correct forms of who/whom/that/which.
1. Avoid contractions (e.g., do not, cannot, will not) - write out words in full.
1. Replace abbreviations like "e.g." with "for example" and "i.e." with "that is".
1. Use headline-style capitalization for headings and titles, sentence case for figure captions and table headers.
1. Avoid using "may" and "should" due to potential ambiguity - use clearer alternatives.
1. Do not state that tasks are easy or simple - focus on how to perform them instead.
1. Avoid first person pronouns (I, we, our).
1. Use "following" with a noun (e.g., "the following steps" not just "the following").
1. Make list items parallel in structure.
1. Avoid noun strings and excessive use of modifiers.
1. Place "only" carefully to avoid ambiguity.
1. Avoid ending sentences with prepositions when possible.
1. Use straight quotation marks and apostrophes, not curly ones.
1. Avoid using "(s)" for plurals - rewrite if necessary.
1. Avoid slashes - use "or" or rewrite the sentence.
1. Include a space between a number and unit of measurement.
1. Use "whether" instead of "if" when referring to alternatives.
1. Avoid anthropomorphism (attributing human characteristics to inanimate objects).
1. Include "that" in clauses unless it results in overly formal writing.
1. Use "this," "that," "these," "those" with a noun for clarity.
1. Avoid unnecessary words - keep writing succinct.
1. Use the serial comma (Oxford comma) in lists.
1. Avoid gerunds in titles, but they can be used for larger content chunks.
1. Use gender-neutral language, including singular "they" when appropriate.
1. Pay attention to sentence structure and syntax, including elliptical sentences, negation, expletives, and cleft sentences.
1. Limit the use of gerund phrases (e.g., "By doing...") at the beginning of sentences to avoid repetitive structure.
1. Avoid vague or overused business jargon:
   - Instead of "leveraging," use specific verbs like "using," "applying," or "implementing."
   - Replace "utilizing" with more precise terms like "employing," "adopting," or "integrating."
   - For blockchain-related content, use concrete terms:
     - Instead of "leveraging blockchain," specify the action: "implementing smart contracts," "using distributed ledger technology," or "applying consensus mechanisms."
   - Always aim for clarity and specificity in describing actions and technologies.
1. Use consistent forms for common Brazilian and blockchain terminology, like "Pix," "Open Finance," "ADA," "BTC."
1. Do not use the word "delve."

### Document Structure:

1. Include an abstract that covers what the document is about, how it conveys information, and why it exists/who it's for.
1. Use descriptive, action-oriented titles for sections (e.g., "Creating Branches" rather than just "Branches").
1. Do not use two consecutive headings without intervening text.
1. Use bulleted lists for 3+ items where order isn't important.
1. Use numbered lists when order matters or you need to refer to specific items.
1. Use variable lists (term followed by definition) for describing a series of terms.
1. Limit nested lists to two levels when possible.
1. Make a full lead-in sentence to introduce a list.
1. Use normal spacing for lists with nested lists, multiple paragraphs, or complex items.
1. For introductions, use "Introduction to \<product_name>" instead of just "Introduction."

### Language and Terminology:

1. Use inclusive language, avoiding terms that might exclude or offend certain groups.
1. Be consistent with terminology - use the same term for the same concept throughout.
1. Avoid redundant words and phrases.
1. Use clear, specific verbs rather than vague ones (e.g., "configure" instead of "set up").
1. Spell out acronyms on first use, followed by the acronym in parentheses.
1. Use the full product name on first mention, then you can abbreviate some names afterwards.
1. Do not use articles (the, a, an) before product names.
1. Do not use possessives with product names.
1. Do not hyphenate or break product names across lines.
1. Capitalize proper nouns and product names correctly to aid translators.
1. Use "email" (no hyphen) and "internet" (lowercase).
1. Follow specific guidelines for presenting names from different cultures (e.g., Korean names).
1. Use appropriate terminology for operating systems, applications, and devices.

### Formatting and Punctuation:

1. Use code blocks for command examples, specifying the language and file path if applicable.
1. Use straight apostrophes, not curly ones.
1. Avoid exclamation points in technical writing.  4. Use serial commas (Oxford commas) in lists.
1. Hyphenate compound modifiers before nouns (e.g., "cloud-based solutions").
1. Do not hyphenate compounds with adverbs ending in -ly.
1. Use non-breaking spaces between numbers and units, and in other cases where words shouldn't be separated.
1. Pay attention to comma usage with phrases and clauses in all positions in a sentence.
1. Be consistent in comma usage relative to quoted material.
1. Use appropriate spacing with slashes and dashes, especially at line ends.

### Writing for Clarity:

1. Keep sentences concise - aim for an average of 15-20 words.
1. Limit paragraphs to 3-5 sentences when possible.
1. Use transitions between paragraphs to improve flow.
1. Break up long procedures into smaller, manageable steps.
1. Use examples to illustrate complex concepts.
1. Define technical terms and jargon on first use.
1. Use consistent capitalization for technical terms.

1. Provide context before details in explanations.
1. Avoid ambiguous pronoun references.
1. Clarify whether nouns are singular or plural in compound phrases.
1. Avoid using "there is" and "there are" constructions when possible.
1. Be careful with the use of "using" to avoid ambiguity.
1. Ensure verb phrases at the start of a sentence modify the correct word.

### Version Numbers and Product Names:

1. Follow other companies' conventions when referring to their products and version numbers.

### References and Citations:

1. Use the IBM Style Guide as a primary reference for technical content.
1. Consult The Chicago Manual of Style (17th Edition) for additional guidance.

### Numbers and Units:

1. Use numerals for percentages, but spell out "percent" in text (e.g., 25 percent).
1. Use numerals with units of measurement, and include a space between the number and unit (e.g., 5 kg, 10 m).

### Quotations:

1. For short quotations (fewer than 100 words), use double quotation marks and incorporate them into the text.
1. For block quotations (100 words or more), indent the entire quotation and omit quotation marks.
1. Use square brackets \[ \] to indicate editorial changes or additions within quotations.
1. Use an ellipsis (...) to indicate omitted material within a quotation.

### Mathematical Notation:

1. Use LaTeX for all mathematical notation to ensure consistency and clarity.
1. Enclose inline mathematical expressions with single dollar signs: $<content>$
   Example: The equation $E = mc^2$ is Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula.
1. For block-level mathematical expressions, use double dollar signs: $$<content>$$
   Example:
   $$
   \\int\_{a}^{b} f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)
   $$
1. Use LaTeX commands for Greek letters, mathematical symbols, and complex notation.
   Example: The symbol $\\alpha$ represents the significance level in hypothesis testing.
1. For multi-line equations, use the `align` environment:
   $$
   \\begin{align}
   y &= mx + b \\
   m &= \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}
   \\end{align}
   $$
1. Use `\text{}` for text within mathematical expressions:
   $$P(\\text{A and B}) = P(A) \\cdot P(B | A)$$
1. For fractions, use `\frac{numerator}{denominator}`:
   $$\\frac{a}{b} + \\frac{c}{d} = \\frac{ad + bc}{bd}$$
1. Use appropriate spacing commands like `\,` (thin space) or `\quad` (wider space) when needed:
   $$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\quad \\text{where } a \\neq 0$$
1. For matrices, use the `matrix`, `pmatrix`, or `bmatrix` environments:
   $$
   A = \\begin{pmatrix}
   a & b \\
   c & d
   \\end{pmatrix}
   $$
1. Remember to escape special characters like % with a backslash when used outside of mathematical contexts.
