# Delegators

When users send transactions inside the Mugraph network, they do it through **Delegators**.

A Delegator is a node, controlled by a single entity, that holds user balances (in Cardano Native Assets) in **shared custody** with the user. Delegators are not full custodians, they can not spend any funds without the rightful owner approval.
